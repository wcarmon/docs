1. Things that are terrible about Golang


# Good news
1. Simple concurrency (compare to java, python, c, c++, js/ts, php)
1. Optimized for readers (compare to rust, c++, c, java, js, ts, ruby, php, python, perl, etc)
1. [defer](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/12)
1. Fast builds (compare to java, c++, rust, ...)
1. Implicit interface implementation
1. Light runtime memory usage (compare to java, python, c#, vb, ruby, php, ...)
1. Multiple return values
1. Methods can declare mutable or read-only receiver


# Bad news
1. Verbose error handling
1. Enums cannot have properties (but they can have methods)
1. Immutability is hard
1. No Sets (must use map[T]bool)
