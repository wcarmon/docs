1. See [abstraction doc](./abstraction.md)
1. For comparison, see the [rust version of this doc](../rust/modeling.md)


# Key Concepts
1. Languages with **strong** modeling tools represent invariants with **types**
    1. Compiler is responsible for enforcing invariants
1. Languages with **weak** modeling tools represent invariants with **methods/logic**
    1. runtime is responsible for enforcing invariants
1. Go has relatively weak modeling tools
    1. (but still stronger than c, javascript, python, all dynamic languages, ...)
    1. [Compare to rust](../rust/modeling.md)
    1. [Compare to kotlin](TODO)
