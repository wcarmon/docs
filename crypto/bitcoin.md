# Overview
1. TODO


# Network
1. Scripting language is limited and only allows what is necessary


# Mining/Verification
1. Miners listen for transactions and create blocks
1. Miners broadcast blocks
1. Anyone can be a block creator (miner)
1. Verification process has tunable complexity, auto adjusted to take about 10 minutes


## Rewards
1. As part of doing the block creation & verification, you add a tx which gives you coin as a block reward
1. Rewards decrease geometrically over time



# Consensus


# TODO: Unorganized
1. Assumptions: Cryptographic hashes are infeasible to reverse (brute force is the best option)
1. Hash is based on all previous transactions
1. Each block has transactions + proof of work
1. A block is only valid if it has proof of work
1. Each block has a hash referencing the previous block (Think Linked List)
