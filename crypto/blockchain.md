# Ledger
1. Ledger: a full history of every transaction that ever occurred
    1. Transactions are between two parties
1. Distributed: no central authority, relies on consensus
1. Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger
1. Cryptocurrency: the Ledger + rules on how to interact with the Ledger
1. Each message has a unique ID to avoid repeat transaction risk
1. Digital Signatures avoid the need for trust (think Key-Pairs)


# Blockchain Trilemma
1. Choose 2 (Getting 2 is easy, 3 is hard)
    1. Security:
        - More nodes == more secure
        - short-term: protection against validation attacks
        - long-term: Immutability (more than 51% of the network or currency supply or similar)
    1. Scalability:
        - Speed/throughput/TPS
    1. Decentralization:
        - no single point-of-failure        


# Setup

## Bitcoin
1. People contribute first
1. Ledger (blockchain) enforces that no one over-drafts
1. Knowing your balance requires looking at the full history of transactions
    1. Think [Kafka](../kafka/readme.md)
1. See [bitcoin.md](./bitcoin.md) doc


## Ethereum
1. See [ethereum.md](./ethereum.md) doc


# Access
1. Bitcoin: Anyone can add to the ledger (Permission-less, no central authority)
1. TODO


# TODO: Unorganized
1. Alternative payment rails to the existing financial system
1. Allows bypassing the swift network
1. Makes sanctions difficult to impose
