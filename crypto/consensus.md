# Overview
1. TODO


# Goal
1. To verify blockchain transactions
1. To decide who updates the blockchain
1. Incentive: Earn (more of) the crypto currency and sometimes transaction fees


# Proof-of-Work (PoW)
1. Used by Bitcoin
1. Incentives: TODO
1. On Conflict: Trust the "branch" that has the most computational work
1. Hard to verify a block, but easy to confirm it's correct
1. Luck is part of it (which can be good or bad)
1. `Pro`: Anyone can verify blocks (no central authority)
1. `Pro`: Distributed
1. `Pro`: Proven
1. `Con`: Favors those with the enough infra (large mining pools)
1. `Con`: Slow by design, limits transaction processing scalability (compare to Visa)
1. `Con`: Difficulty increases with number of Miners/Verifiers
1. `Con`: High infrastructure costs
1. `Con`: Energy inefficient (and gets worse as Miners join)

## Fraud risk
1. Need 51% of the network to take over



# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
1. Used by Ethereum
1. Rewards those who put up their coins/tokens as collateral
1. Incentives: transaction fees
1. Only one verifier/miner selected to build the block (lottery, mostly random selection)
1. `Pro`: Energy efficient (compared to PoW)
1. `Pro`:
1. `Pro`: TODO
1. `Con`: Must own/purchase enough native currency first
1. `Con`: Favors wealthy verifiers/miners
1. `Con`: TODO

## Fraud risk
1. Coins lost if verifier/miner behaves fraudulently


# TODO: Unorganized
1. Validators == Miners
1. PoH, PoET, DBFT
