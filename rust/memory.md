# Overview
1. TODO


# Key Concepts
1. All values in Rust are stack allocated by default
1. All heap access happens thru a pointer


# Stack
1. Size must be known at compile time to live on stack
1. Pointers have fixed size (their subject lives on the heap)


# Heap
1. All heap access happens thru a pointer
