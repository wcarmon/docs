1. Things that are excellent about Rust
1. Things that are terrible about Rust


# Good news
1. Light runtime memory usage (compare to java, go, python, c#, vb, ruby, php, ...)
1. Multiple return values
1. "Sensible" Operator overloading
1. Set support (compare to Go)
1. Methods must declare mutability requirements
1. Struct fields support default values (compare to Go)

# Bad news
1. Slow builds
1. Syntax is dense
1. "Sometimes" file-names and module-names are associated (eg `mod foo` must be in `foo.rs`)
